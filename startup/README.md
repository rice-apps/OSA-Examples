This folder contains the boilerplate code for a simple web application using React. 

# Routing
This boilerplate uses the highly effective `react-router`v6 for routing, and contains a basic example using a `Home` and `Profile` page.

# How to Create a New Page
In order to create a new page, we've provided a simple `Template.jsx` which you can copy and paste into a new component at any time; you'll still have to perform the imports on your own, but this will save you around 30 seconds of typing for each new component you create :)
